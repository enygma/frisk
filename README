Frisk : Lightweight Functional Testing
#######################

Frisk is (mostly) a proof-of-concept functional testing framework. It allows
for simple gets/posts and passing the results through assertions to test their 
content.

The current feature set allows you to:
	- make POST requests
	- make GET requests
	- check results for exact equal
	- check results for containing match
	
Install
--------------
No install really needed - tests go in the /tests folder and the "frisk"
file needs to be made executable. Oh, and you might want to change the PHP
path at the top of it.

TODO
--------------
> allow for a config file
> standardize the interfaces for asserts/actions
> (obvious) add more actions and assertions...
