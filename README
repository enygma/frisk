Frisk : Lightweight Functional Testing
#######################

Frisk is functional testing framework designed to be run from the command line. It 
allows for simple gets/posts and passing the results through assertions to test the 
resulting content.

If you're familiar at all with the PHP unit testing framework PHPUnit (http://phpunit.de)
you'll find a lot of similarities  with frisk. Several of the concepts and methods names
have been borrowed to help make frisk easier to pick up.

* NOTE: For the most up-to-date information about frisk, please visit the wiki on the
	project's github page: https://github.com/enygma/frisk/wiki
-------------

The current feature set allows you to:
	- make POST requests
	- make GET requests
	- check results for exact equal
	- check results for containing match
	- oraganize your code into testing suites
	- and more...

Requirements
--------------
> PHP 5.2+
> pecl_http extension
	
Install
--------------
No install really needed - tests go in the /tests folder and the "frisk"
file needs to be made executable. Oh, and you might want to change the PHP
path at the top of it.

Example:
--------------
<?php

class MyTest extends Test {

	public function test(){
		$data=array('key1'=>'value1');
		$this->get('/foo.php','www.myhost.com')
			->submitForm($data)
			->assertContains('foo');
	}

}

?>

Additionally, assertions can be called with "Not" in them to negate the check.
For example:
	->assertContains('foo');
	versus
	->assertNotContains('foo');
