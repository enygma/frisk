Frisk : Lightweight Functional Testing
#######################

Frisk is (mostly) a proof-of-concept functional testing framework. It allows
for simple gets/posts and passing the results through assertions to test their 
content.

The current feature set allows you to:
	- make POST requests
	- make GET requests
	- check results for exact equal
	- check results for containing match
